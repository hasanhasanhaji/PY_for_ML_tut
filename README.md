🛠️ Installation

Use the following steps to set up the environment:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/hasanhasanhaji/PY_for_ML_tut.git


Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows


Install dependencies (if any):

pip install -r requirements.txt

📚 Getting Started

To begin learning:

Start from the folder 1-Python Basics/ and open the tutorial files.

Work through the examples and exercises.

Run code in an interactive environment such as:

Jupyter Notebook

Google Colab

VS Code Python environment

📊 Using These Skills in ML

Once you finish the Python basics:

Apply what you’ve learned to data loading, cleaning, and visualization.

Move on to machine learning libraries like:

NumPy – for numerical computing

pandas – for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualization

Scikit-learn – for basic ML algorithms
These skills are essential before diving into model training and evaluation.
